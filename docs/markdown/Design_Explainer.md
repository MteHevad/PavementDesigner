# Design Criteria

This step is a continuation of the prior step in providing the inputs needed to solve for the required
structural number. The difference is that these values do not pertain to traffic.

### Reliability ###
The probability the pavement condition will not fall below the minimum serviceability index (1.0-5.0).
Generally, there are recommended ranges based on functional classification:

- Freeways: 85-99.9%
- Arterials: 80-99%
- Collectors: 80-95%
- Local: 50-80%

### Standard Error ###
This represents error in both traffic and pavement performance. Typical values of Standard Error used are 0.40 to 0.50 for flexible pavements and 0.35 to 0.40 for rigid pavements.

### Serviceability Index Change ###
Also referred to as Î”PSI. This is the change from the expected serviceability immediately after construction to the
level of serviceability where the pavement will require replacement.

### Resilient Modulus ###
This is the stiffness of the underlying soil. Often, this is estimated from the results of other soil tests such
as the California Bearing Ratio (CBR). Normally, this is provided by a geotechnical analysis; however, there are 
ranges of values that are typical to soil types that may be known by referencing a soil map or knowledge of the road
location.
